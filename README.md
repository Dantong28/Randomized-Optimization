# Randomized-Optimization
Dantong Zhu CS 7641 project 2

Section 1:
The dataset is the forest fire dataset from UCI, available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires. Code and the dataset can be found in the folder NN.

Section 2:
The three optimization problems chosen are Traveling Salesman Problem, Four Peaks, and Continuous Peaks. Code can be found in the folder Opt Prob.

The code is implemented in jython modified from the optimization algorithms in ABAGAIL. To run the code:
1. Install jython and ABAGAIL
2. Change each piece of code so that the ABAGAIL.jar is added to the system path (or add ABAGAIL to the jython path)
(i.e. replace this line:
sys.path.append("/Users/dantongzhu/Documents/Spring 2019/Machine Learning/project 2/ABAGAIL/ABAGAIL.jar")
)
